# Privify

Your real-time privacy coach - flagging sensitive comments, encrypting every step, and building safer habits powered by fully homomorphic encryption and on-device AI.

## üì± Project Structure

This repository contains two applications that provide the same privacy dashboard view:

- **`reactlynx-app/`** - Web application built with React 17 and vanilla JavaScript
- **`reactlynx-mobile/`** - Mobile application built with ReactLynx framework and TypeScript

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Running the Web Application (reactlynx-app)

```bash
# Navigate to the web app directory
cd reactlynx-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The web application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Running the Mobile Application (reactlynx-mobile)

```bash
# Navigate to the mobile app directory
cd reactlynx-mobile

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The mobile application will start and display a QR code in the terminal. Scan this QR code with your LynxExplorer App to view the mobile version.
